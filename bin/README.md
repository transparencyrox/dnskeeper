# Heroku C++ with CMake buildpack

This buildpack allows one to build and release CMake based C++ code from Heroku. This is needed since Heroku does not natively support C++ as a part of its default language set.

> Note: This code has been replicated on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/harsh-sgp/heroku-cpp.git)
